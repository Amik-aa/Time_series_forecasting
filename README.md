Firstly we have used augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for checking the stationarity of a time series, and forecasted time series
using ARIMA model but since the ARIMA model assumes that the time series is stationary,we needed to use a different model which is SARIMAX,this
model takes into account exogenous variables.
